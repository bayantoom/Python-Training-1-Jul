# Python Training Day 6

This README file provide a brief summary of what I have learned in this module.


## Persistence: 

### File Handling: 
- **Read from a file.**
- **Write to a file.**
- **We must close the file after finishing using it.** 


### File Modes:
- **`r`:** Opens a file for reading. (default)
- **`w`:** Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.
- **`a`:** Opens a file for appending. Creates a new file if it does not exist.
- **`x`:** Creates a new file. Returns an error if the file exists.
- **`r+`:** Opens a file for reading and writing.
- **`w+`:** Opens a file for writing and reading. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.

### Readin and Writing CSV files: 
- **Used to store tabular data.**
- **We can read and write CSV files using built-in module "csv".**


### Serialization and Deserialization: 
- **The process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted.**
- **the process of converting the serialized data back into an object.**
- **We use built-in modules like `pickle` and `json` for serialization and deserialization.**
